## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

This project was made to help users grab weather info for a city. I learned how to store items in local storage as an array, how to go through each items of that local storage, how to use fetch(), and how to access data and put it onto a page.

## Usage

Open the index.html file, and then type in a city you want to see the weather info for.
